"A few things:
1. You can nest SSR components inside CSR components, it just leaves a slot for the SSR component.
2. "All the benefit of using Next.js" does not end at SSR. There is so much more to it, like a solid page router, server actions, and a ton of other built-in goodies.
3. ALSO, 'use client' doesn't actually remove the benefits of SSR.
When a client is marked with 'user client', the static page is still generated on the server,
as much as it can, but is then hydrated on the client."
